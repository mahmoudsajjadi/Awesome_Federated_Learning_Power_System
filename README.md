## Featured Research Paper

- **Title:** Towards Distributed Learning of PMU Data: A Federated Learning-based Event Classification Approach
  - **TLDR:** Proposing a federated XGBoost model, where each entity constructs the same set of event features with varying numbers of PMUs. This approach achieves nearly the same performance as centralized counterparts and demonstrates robustness against different data distributions among entities.
